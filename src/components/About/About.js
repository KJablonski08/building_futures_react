						<h3>About Us</h3>
						<p>
							Jim Nowak and Adam Jablonski first crossed paths in December of
							2005. Two months later, they began walking the same path in Kenya,
							and they never separated. It was here that seeds for what would
							become Building Futures, Inc was formed. They were working with
							another organization when the idea came to them. It was a
							different way of approaching these marvelous people and helping
							them to achieve their goals. Two years later, Building Futures,
							Inc. became a reality. Our service work is incredibly rewarding.
							Every smile on a child’s face, every tear of joy on a parent’s
							cheek, and every gentle touch from the elderly keep us coming
							back. They are constant reminders that we are doing the right
							thing for the right reason.

					<h3>Director: Adam Jablonski</h3>
					<p>
						Adam and his wife Andrea have three children and recently celebrated
						their 27th anniversary. Katie, a graduate of Stonehill College, is a
						Sales Representative with W.B. Mason Company. Kevin is a graduate of
						St. John Fisher College and is also employed by W.B. Mason Company.
						Karen, is in her senior year at St. Bonaventure University pursuing
						a teaching degree. The entire family is active within the
						organization both in Kenya and here in the US. Whether making kits
						for the Pad Project in their home or planting trees as a family in
						Kenya, everyone is eager to help make a difference. They’re happy to
						bring friends to Africa, too! Over the last few years, they’ve
						introduced dozens of people to this part of the world and the
						marvelous people they’ve befriended there. “Traveling to Kenya is
						not for everyone. It’s a lot of traveling, and the living conditions
						while in country are very different. We’ve been blessed to be able
						to take the time to travel here as a family, and have the people in
						Kenya become members of our extended family. The privilege for us to
						watch our families grow is priceless.”

					<h3>Director: Steve Erickson</h3>
					<p>
						Steve has an extensive background in Education, Banking, Insurance
						and Non-Profit Management and is in charge of the finances of our
						organization. He is married to his wife of 36 years, Janet, and they
						have been Fairport residents for 25 years. Janet has helped organize
						fundraisers at French Road Elementary School and is encouraging in
						all matters behind the scenes. Both daughters, Leigh and Jessie, had
						an affinity for Jim Nowak as their teacher (as they did for many of
						their Fairport teachers) and have been actively involved in the
						organization’s fund raising activities. “Four years ago I met Jim
						Nowak while he was fixing our pool (that no one else would fix) and
						I heard about what he and Adam were doing with Building Futures in
						Kenya and I jumped in to help out with the accounting and paperwork.
						It has been gratifying to contribute to the various activities of
						Building Futures, Inc. These activities have exposed the innate
						human compassion of children and adults here in America and in
						Africa. This kind of work makes the world a better and more peaceful
						place. Don’t just sit there... hit the donate button! You’ll be glad
						you did!””

					<h3>Director: Tim Slisz</h3>
					<p>
						A 47 year resident of Fairport, Tim got his Bachelors and Masters
						Degrees from Nazareth College. Tim first met co-founder Jim Nowak in
						High School. “He was my history teacher and was a leader in a
						program called Senior Seminar, a group that met to discuss world
						issues. His spark ignited in me the drive and desire to help those
						in need, no matter where they live. When I started teaching 6th
						grade in 1990, I reconnected with Jim. His energy was stronger than
						ever and he has always been a driving force in my teaching.” Soon
						after teaching began, Tim started fostering children who needed a
						safe place to stay. Over the last 20 years, Tim has had 10 children
						stay in his home at various times and for various reasons and the
						two children that stayed the longest were Haitian refugees. “To this
						day, they are a very big part of my life. My one son has 2 children
						thus I have become known as Papa Tim - a name more precious than
						gold!” When not helping others in the community, Tim can be found
						working on and driving his antique Ford Model T, walking and hiking
						with his two English Springer Spaniels, enjoying the grand kids,
						exploring Adirondack State Park, relaxing on Martha’s Vineyard or
						out on his friends’ various dairy farms. Tim is currently a member
						of the Village Board of Trustees, sits on the Board of Directors for
						Linwood Gardens Ltd. and is a religion teacher for the Church of the
						Assumption in Fairport.”

						Masai Mara Game Preserve where he is an accomplished guide. If you
						ever have an opportunity to visit Maasai Mara, you won’t find a
						better guide than Isaac!”
