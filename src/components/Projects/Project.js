				When we began walking this path, we never imagined how far our feet
				would carry us. Itâ€™s difficult to describe the transformations we
				facilitate, so we thought it would be easier to simply show you. Whether
				we are reconstructing classrooms or building a new facility, the
				transformations are always remarkable. These are just a few of the
				examples that show the contrasts between what we find and what we are
				able to do with it. We do this work together. These projects are always
				a group effort that combines laborers in Kenya, Kenyan suppliers, BFI
				members, and the prayers, well-wishes and donations of thousands of
				individuals. These changes cannot happen without people like you!
