## Building Futures

Building Futures is a blogging application that was created for Building Futures Inc. Building Futures, Inc., is an IRS authorized 501(c)3. Their mission is to aid in the education and welfare of impoverished Kenyans. The building futures blog is a place for supporters to get up to date information on the latest projects and updates from directors through blog posts. Dirctors are able to log in and create new posts. Anyone who does not have a director login has read only access to all blog posts.

### Motivation
I was able to help by creating a custom blogging application for supporters to visit and see updates on the work that Building Futures is doing. Building Futures is run by volunteers and commits to spending 100% of the money donated to funding their sustainable development projects in Kenya. They don't have the budget for a website and I was thrilled to have the privilege to provide this for them.
I cannot wait to see what we add next!
